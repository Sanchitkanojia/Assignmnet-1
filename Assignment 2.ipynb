    "\n",
    "Ans. The Boolean data type represents a logical value that can have one of two possible states: \"true\" or \"false\". These values are used to express the truth or falsehood of a statement or condition in programming. In different programming languages, these values may be represented in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True: This represents the value for a true or affirmative condition. It is often represented by the keyword \"true\" in many programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Java. In some languages, it can also be represented by the integer value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. False: This represents the value for a false or negative condition. It is often represented by the keyword \"false\" in many programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Java. In some languages, it can also be represented by the integer value 0.\n",

    "Q2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.The three different types of Boolean operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AND operator (&&): The AND operator returns \"true\" if both operands or conditions are true. Otherwise, it returns \"false\". It can be represented using the \"&&\" symbol in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OR operator (||): The OR operator returns \"true\" if at least one of the operands or conditions is true. It returns \"false\" if both operands are false. It can be represented using the \"||\" symbol in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. NOT operator (!): The NOT operator (also known as the negation operator) is a unary operator that reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, the NOT operator makes it false, and vice versa. It can be represented using the \"!\" symbol in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "These Boolean operators are commonly used in conditional statements, logical expressions, and boolean algebra to evaluate and manipulate logical conditions.\n",

    "values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Here are the truth tables for each Boolean operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AND Operator (&&):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if operand 1 is true and operand 2 is also true, then the result is true.\n",

    "if operand 1 is false and operand 2 is also false, then the result false \n",

    "Q5. What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The six comparison operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equal to (==): This operator checks if two operands are equal and returns \"true\" if they are, and \"false\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Not equal to (!=): This operator checks if two operands are not equal and returns \"true\" if they are not equal, and \"false\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Greater than (>): This operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand and returns \"true\" if it is, and \"false\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Less than (<): This operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand and returns \"true\" if it is, and \"false\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand and returns \"true\" if it is, and \"false\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Less than or equal to (<=): This operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand and returns \"true\" if it is, and \"false\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "These comparison operators are commonly used to compare values and conditions in programming languages to determine their relationship and evaluate logical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a\n",
    "condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The equal to operator (==) and the assignment operator (=) serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's how you can differentiate between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equal to Operator (==):\n",
    "\n",
    "    The equal to operator (==) is a comparison operator used to check if two values are equal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It returns true if the values on both sides of the operator are equal, and false otherwise.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It is used in conditional statements, comparisons, and logical expressions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: if (x == 5) checks if the value of variable x is equal to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assignment Operator (=):\n",
    "\n",
    "    The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It takes the value on the right-hand side and assigns it to the variable on the left-hand side.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It does not perform any comparison or evaluation, but simply assigns the value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To illustrate their difference, consider the following condition and its appropriate usage:\n",
    "\n",
